#a = minuites to drive to arnar
#b = the amount of time it will take to drive from arnars to the movies
#c = the time when the movie will start
# so game plan is to add a and b then subtract that from c, and print that number
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
subtract = a+b
print (c - subtract)
